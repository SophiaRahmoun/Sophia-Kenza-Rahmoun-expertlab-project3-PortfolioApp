# Sophia-Kenza-Rahmoun - Expertlab Project 3 - Portfolio App

This project is a **one-page animated portfolio** built in SwiftUI for iOS. It showcases previous Expertlab work in a personalized, highly stylized environment using animations, reusable components, and custom assets.

## How to Run

- Open the project in Xcode 15+
- Make sure to enable Developer Mode on your Mac (see link below)
- No external packages or login needed
- All assets and fonts are included in the repo
- No backend dependencies

## Key Learnings

- Component reusability and modular architecture
- Custom animations and transitions
- Font and asset integration using `.xcassets`
- JSON parsing with `Codable` structures
- Slider & carousel mechanics
- Building an interactive UI that runs smoothly across devices


## Limitations & Future Work

Due to time constraints, the full design vision wasn’t implemented. In the future, improvements could include:
- Real-time project updates from a CMS
- Full responsiveness across all iOS devices
- Integration of user interaction metrics
